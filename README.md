# webscraping-and-data-analysis-with-python
This project is a Python-based tool designed to scrape data from websites and perform data analysis to extract trends or insights. A practical example implemented in this project includes scraping news articles and analyzing their sentiment over time.
Features
Web Scraping: Extract news articles from various sources

Sentiment Analysis: Analyze article sentiment using TextBlob and NLTK's VADER

Trend Visualization: Generate charts showing sentiment over time

Word Frequency Analysis: Identify most common words by sentiment category

Configurable: Easily add new news sources via configuration

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-sentiment-analyzer.git
cd news-sentiment-analyzer
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download NLTK data:

python
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('vader_lexicon'); nltk.download('punkt')"
Usage
Run the main script:

bash
python main.py
You'll be prompted to:

Enter a search query (e.g., "climate change")

Specify how many articles to analyze (10-100)

Results will be saved in the results/ directory including:

CSV file with all article data and sentiment scores

PNG files with visualizations

Console output with top words by sentiment

Example Output
Sentiment Over Time
Sentiment Over Time

Sentiment Distribution
Sentiment Distribution

Configuration
Edit config.py to:

Add new news sources

Adjust sentiment analysis thresholds

Change time intervals for trend analysis

Example configuration:

python
NEWS_SOURCES = {
    'CNN': {
        'base_url': 'https://www.cnn.com',
        'search_url': 'https://www.cnn.com/search?q={query}&size={count}&from={start}&page={page}',
        'article_selector': 'div.container__field-links a',
        # ... other selectors
    }
}

ANALYSIS_CONFIG = {
    'sentiment_threshold': 0.2,  # Adjust sensitivity
    'time_interval': 'W'  # Weekly analysis
}

Ethical Considerations
Always check a website's robots.txt before scraping

Respect crawl delays and scraping restrictions

Don't overwhelm servers with too many rapid requests

Cache results to avoid repeated scraping
